# Reddit Mini Clone

This project is a simple clone of Reddit, built to demonstrate the use of React components and React Hooks.

The page loads the 25 most popular subreddit categories and fetches the latest posts from the active subreddit. Additionally, I have implemented a search function that allows you to search among the posts in the active subreddit.

Users can also view comments with timestamps and usernames, as well as upvote and downvote posts. This provides an interactive experience that mimics the real Reddit environment.
